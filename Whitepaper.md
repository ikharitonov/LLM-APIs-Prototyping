### Purpose of project:

The aim of this system is to simplify the life of people who want to travel but hate planning. This tool has to purpose to create custom itineraries for anyone interested based on certain the customer’s preferences. 

For example say Alex likes travelling but doesn’t like planning or researching things to do, places to visit, restaurants to eat. He has many friends who enjoy travelling but he doesn’t know how to go about finding the best deals for his travels and still have a great time. 
Alex wants to travel for a week in europe but doesn’t know how to find the optimal location that matches his budget and travel preferences. Our tool will develop an itinerary with recommendations such as:

- Recommendations on destinations
- Optimal Flights
- Stays dependending on the budget
- Places to visit - based on online guides, google maps reviews
- Restaurants
- etc..
